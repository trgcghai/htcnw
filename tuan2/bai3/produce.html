              The Sunny Acres Farmshop aims to offer the highest quality fresh
              produce. You can pick your own or buy it in our shop. Set amidst
              acres of outstanding natural beauty on the beautiful rolling hills
              northeast of Council Bluffs, the Farm Shop is easily reached on
              Highway G, with easy access from Interstate 80.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The Farm Shop was established over 25 years ago with great
              success. Our products have won numerous awards at local festivals
              and fairs. We also cater to local supermarkets in the Council
              Bluffs/Omaha area. Look for our products every Saturday morning
              from May to October at the Council Bluffs Farmers' Market.
            </p>

              When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a
              good fright. Sunny Acres provides that too with another year of
              the Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends in
              October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.

          Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always
          open with reasonable prices and great produce. Save even more money by
          picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.

          We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
