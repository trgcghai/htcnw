              Back for another year, every night, the Sunny Acres Corn Maze
              becomes the Sunny Acres Haunted Maze. This season's maze begins
              with an encounter with an evil organist (played by the Council
              Bluff Choir's own Glenn Frye). Explore the maze and find the
              zombie graveyard, the pumpkin tower, and a haunted house made of
              corn, not to mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other
              assorted villainy that inhabit the maze.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October with a
              special event on Halloween. Come early in the day to explore the
              larger Corn Maze, stay for a homemade meal of brats and burgers,
              soda, and chips, and then participate in the Halloween Festival.
              Special stations will be set up in the Haunted Maze for
              trick-or-treaters. A smaller maze is also available that is
              "scare-friendly" for younger children.
            </p>

              When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a
              good fright. Sunny Acres provides that too with another year of
              the Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends in
              October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.

          Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always
          open with reasonable prices and great produce. Save even more money by
          picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
